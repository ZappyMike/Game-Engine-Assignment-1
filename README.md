# Game-Engine-Assignment-1

This assignment is a level prototype. 

Controls: 
Move left or right with A and D or the arrow keys
Jump with the space bar (you can jump endlessly so keep pressing space to stay in the air)

Description:
This project is a 2D, single player game. The point of the game is to move and jump past and around a series of obstacles. Once you pass them all, the game will be over and you will win. If you collide with any of the obstacles, however, you will lose and will be taken to the lose screen.
